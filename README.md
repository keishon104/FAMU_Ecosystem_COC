# FAMU Ecosystem Code of Conduct
### This code of conduct outlines our expections of behavior for engagement (online and in-person) with each other as members of the FAMU ecosystem community. The FAMU ecosystem community includes our board, student associates, mentors, staff, entrepreneurs, and event attendees. This guide also includes steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from participating further as a FAMU ecosystem community member.

### FAMU ecosystem is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, and political affiliation, as well as gender expression, mental illness, socioeconomic status or background, physical appearance, or body size. Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor radical inclusion and diversity. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above. We seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

### We do not tolerate harrassment of community members in any form. Harassment includes:

#### Offensive comments related to protected characteristics above
#### Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices
#### Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person's gender identity. You must address people by the name and pronoun they give
#### Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "hug" or "backrub") without consent or after a request to stop
#### Threats of violence, both physical and psychological
#### Deliberate intimidation
#### Stalking or following
#### Harassing photography
#### Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior
#### Pattern of inappropriate social contact with others, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
#### Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
#### Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent

### Our community priotizes marginalized people's safety over privileged people's comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

#### ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
#### Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
#### Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
#### Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
#### Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### Reporting Issues
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior -- or have any other concerns -- please report it by contacting our Community Director, Keishon Smith, via email at keishon104@gmail.com. All reports will be handled with discretion.
